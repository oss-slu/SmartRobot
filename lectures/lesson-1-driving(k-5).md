# Earleist-level Lesson 1: Learning How to Drive

Welcome to **MORPH's** first lesson!  
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to drive your robot using a keyboard (**W, A, S, D**) or on-screen buttons. By the end, you’ll know how to make it go **forward**, **backward**, and **turn**.

## Task 1: Meet Your Robot

Look at your robot for a moment.

- It has wheels on the **left side**.
- It has wheels on the **right side**.

Think of it like this:

- If **both sides** roll forward, the whole robot moves **forward**.
- If **both sides** roll backward, the whole robot goes **backward**.
- If **one side** rolls forward and the **other** rolls backward, the robot **turns in place**.

Just remember that the robot moves because its **left and right wheels spin**.

## Task 2: Open the Driving Screen

On your computer, open the **robot-driving app** that your teacher showed you.

You should see:

- Buttons or arrows that say **Up, Down, Left, Right,** and **Stop**.
- A place that shows if the robot is **connected**.

Ask your teacher to make sure the robot is connected and ready.

## Task 3: Learn the Driving Keys (W, A, S, D)

Now look at the keyboard. Find these letters:

- **W**
- **A**
- **S**
- **D**

For this robot, they mean:

- **W** → go **forward**
- **S** → go **backward**
- **A** → turn **left**
- **D** → turn **right**
- **Space bar** → **stop**

You can think:

- “**W** means both wheels forward.”
- “**S** means both wheels backward.”
- “**A** means turn left.”
- “**D** means turn right.”

## Task 4: Drive with the Buttons

Let’s practice using the buttons first.

1. Press the **Up / W** button.  
   Watch your robot. What happens to its wheels?  
   You should see **both sides** of the robot move forward. The robot goes **forward**.

2. Press the **Down / S** button.  
   Now, both sides move **backward**, and the robot goes **backward**.

3. Press the **Left / A** button.  
   The **right wheels** move forward, and the **left wheels** move backward; the robot **turns left**.

4. Press the **Right / D** button.  
   The **left wheels** move forward, and the **right wheels** move backward; the robot **turns right**.

5. Press **Stop / Space bar**.  
   The robot should **stop moving**.

Try that a few times. Note what you think will happen when you press each button, and predict how you might navigate to somewhere in the room with a combination of the buttons.

**Example:**

- “I want to go to the door in the corner of the room, so I’ll move forward, turn right, and move forward again.”  
- “I want my robot to look out the window. I’ll move back from my current spot, turn right, and move forward to the window.”

## Task 5: Try It With Your Own Task!

Now try driving the robot with the keyboard and each new button:

1. Find somewhere in the room where you want to move your robot. It’s probably going to take a few moving steps to get to your destination.
2. What is a **sequence of steps** that you can take to move to that spot? Should you move **forward, left, right,** or **backward**, and in what order?
3. Write down your **prediction** of the steps to make the robot move to your destination.
4. With your teacher's permission, try following those steps with **WASD** controls and see if you can end up at that spot.
5. After arriving at your destination, note if the commands you planned on running got you to where you wanted to go, or if you had to change some things around.

If you can do this and explain what the robot’s wheels are doing, you’ve passed **Lesson 1: Learning How to Drive!**
