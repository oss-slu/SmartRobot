## About SMARTRobot
Welcome to SMARTRobot, the all-in-one platform for robotics coding practice! We believe that hands-on experience is the best way to learn robotics. That's why we've created a platform that combines easy-to-use hardware with a powerful, web-based coding environment.

Our goal is to make robotics and programming accessible to everyone, whether you're a student, a hobbyist, or just getting started.

## Our Vision
SMARTRobot was founded on the idea that learning should be fun and interactive. We've designed our platform to remove the complexities of traditional robotics, so you can focus on what matters most: writing code and seeing your creations come to life.

We are passionate about empowering the next generation of innovators by providing the tools and knowledge they need to build, code, and create.

## Key Features
Hands-On Learning: Build a physical robot and control it with your code.

Web-Based Control: Use our intuitive website to write code, send commands, and monitor your robot.

Modular Design: Our robot is built with easily swappable parts, allowing you to experiment and expand your skills.

Comprehensive Guide: Our user manual provides everything you need to get started, from assembly to advanced programming.
