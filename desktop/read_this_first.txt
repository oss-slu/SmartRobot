Hi there, old or new fellows trying to add/ delete something from this codebase
I don't know how big the project will be, go big or go home
but if you're contributing to this project, welcome and I recommend you to
read this before doing anything
First, let do headcount

NUM_PEOPLE_READ_THIS_NOTE = 1
NUM_PEOPLE_MODIFY_THIS_NOTE= 1

NOTE: (welcome to add more notes as the project growing)
 1. If you feel lost, read #IF_YOU_WANT
 2. If you vibe-code with Cusor (or something similar), be careful with Agent mode
 rec to use Ask mode first and selectively modify on your own
 3. Think carefully before touching \desktop\foxglove
 3. Did you read Contributing_Guide and ISSUE_TEMPLATE?
 4. Love interactive design, feel free to pitch/add your cool ideas (but read note 3. again)

#IF_YOU_WANT
1.Add a new page	
Create desktop\features\[page_name]\ folder
Create __init__.py with blueprint
Create routes.py with route function (HTTP route)
Create template (specific for this page): features\[page_name]\templates\[feature_name].html
Create static (specific for this page): features\[feature_name]\static\(.css or .js)
Register blueprint in desktop/setup.py


3.Deal with everything on Control Panel (or My Robot page)
- Control panel URL-->features/my_robot/routes.py
- UI layout/structure-->features/my_robot/templates/my_robot.html
- Styling (colors, layout)-->features/my_robot/static/css/my_robot.css
- Button behavior (frontend)-->features/my_robot/static/js/websocket.js
- WebSocket events (backend)-->features/my_robot/socket_handlers.py
- Movement commands-->utils/command_converter.py
- Movement speeds-->config.py
- Robot IP/port-->config.py
- Robot communication-->foxglove/bridge.py

3. Add content for landing page
Look at \desktop\features\home\templates\index.html
